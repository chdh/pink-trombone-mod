# pink-trombone-mod

This is a revised version of the Pink Trombone speech
synthesizer originally developed by Neil Thapen in 2017.
The original source code was modularized and converted to TypeScript.

Pink Trombone uses two-dimensional
[digital waveguide synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_waveguide_synthesis)
to synthesize human speech sounds.
